  - title: "Topic: The 12-Factor Application"
    assignee: *new_hire
    tags:
      - Application Developer
    description: | 
      Delivering applications on Kubernetes is much simpler when they adhere to the [12-factor application principles][1] (or [in Korean][2]).

      These principles provide the foundation of successful architectures in cloud computing platforms.
      Legacy applications will migrate into containers and Kubernetes most readily with small, focused changes to adopt the 12-factor principles.

      New applications should be developed with these principles in mind.
